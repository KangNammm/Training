    <h4> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.</h4>
    <p id="name"> With CSS, you can control the color, fort, the size of the text, the spacing between, how elements are positioned and laid out, what
        background images or background colors are to be used, different devices and screen sizes, and much more!
    </p>
    <div>
        <p><span>Tip:</span> The word <span> cascading</span> means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children element within the parent. So, if you
        set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless
        you spencify something else)!</p>
